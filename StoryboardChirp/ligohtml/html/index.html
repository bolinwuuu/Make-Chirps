    <p id="rcorners4" style="height: 200px"> <p class="body-text">In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein's special and general theories of relativity caused an upheaval in the world of physics. Newton’s theories were considered well established through experiment, with only minor discrepancies observed, but those discrepancies proved to be valuable clues toward a new theory of reality. Einstein realized that Newton's Laws break down at very high speeds, near the speed of light, and near very massive objects like stars, including our own Sun. 
        His solution revolutionized our understanding of both space and time.

<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 170px"> <p class="body-text">Surprisingly, some of the implications of his theory were proven to be accurate and useful in the area of satellite communications and GPS technologies. However, many of the implications of these theories of relativity, such as black holes and the bending of light by massive gravitational fields created by such objects as galaxy clusters, generally happen thousands of light years away from us, making predictions difficult to confirm without  the help of extremely precise instruments.</p>

<div class="centering"
	<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 170px"> <p class="body-text">It was exactly this problem that researchers who were trying to experimentally confirm the existence of gravitational waves, which Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicted would emanate from massive objects with high acceleration such as colliding black holes and neutron stars. These very violent events would distort space-time itself, sending out gravitational ripples that travel at the speed of light.

<div class="centering"
<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 230px"> <p class="body-text"> Experimental data did indeed corroborate the possible emission of gravitational waves through indirect means; for example, the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics was given to Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor Jr. "for the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation" because they discovered that the rate of acceleration of orbiting neutron stars matched with the predictions from Einstein’s theory of general relativity, provided that gravitational waves were being omitted, discharging energy with them. However, this was not a direct observation of gravitational waves.

<div class="centering"
<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 135px"> <p class="body-text">LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) set out to detect these waves directly. However, these ripples in space-time, just as ripples in water, became weaker and smaller as they spread away from the source of the waves. In this case, the waves of space itself have an amplitude, by the time they reach Earth, of one part in billion-trillion or less.

<div class="centering"
<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 340px"> <p class="body-text">Through the construction of extremely high-precision laser interferometers, whose arms are 4 kilometers long (about 2.5 miles long, see photo), the scientists of LIGO seeked to finally directly measure the effects of gravitational waves directly. Lasers would stretch across one end of each arm to the other and consequently measure the distance between the distance of the arms. When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, one would expect the arms to undulate in length, becoming shorter and longer than usual due to the ripples in space time. These fluctuations are tiny, smaller than one thousandth of the diameter of a proton, but they lead to telltale flickers in the output light of the interferometer. LIGO scientists and engineers needed years of design, painstaking construction and careful measurement to be able to differentiate real gravitational waves from light flickers caused by terrestrial disturbances, such as road traffic, earthquakes, and thunderstorms.

<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 190px"> <p class="body-text">In 2015, LIGO finally detected light flickers due to gravitational waves emitted in the collision of two massive black holes, each about 30 times the mass of the Sun, that merged 1.3 billion light years ago. This discovery of gravitational waves, an experimental confirmation of Einstein’s general relativity about a century after it was proposed, led to the awarding of the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. </p>

<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 170px"> <p class="body-text">Large-scale gravitational wave detection experiments form a collaboration called LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, composed of LIGO in North America with its interferometers in Louisiana and Washington; Virgo, the European organization with its interferometer in Italy; and KAGRA (the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, an underground interferometer) in Japan. Together they conduct coordinated observation runs in order to make the best use of coincident detections.  </p>

<p id="rcorners4" style="height: 270px"> <p class="body-text">Observing the same signal from multiple detectors across the globe allows triangulation of the source location on the sky, which aids “electromagnetic astronomers” to point their telescopes in that direction, to look for counterparts at various light wavelengths (radio waves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays). This approach led to a dramatic success in 2017 with the first gravitational wave detection of a merger between two neutron stars. Electromagnetic counterparts were found in the aftermath radiation at the triangulated location in all of the above wavelength ranges. These observations confirmed that a substantial fraction, if not all, of the heaviest elements in the Universe, such as gold and uranium, are produced in binary neutron star mergers.
